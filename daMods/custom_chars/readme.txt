here you gotta put your character .png and .xml, and then just copy the template.json and addapt it and then add the stuff on custom_chars.jsonc file

WARNING: This folder is unfinished, so there is a lot of mess, i'll clean up the mess on the final build (also, ignore the template character, its just to show how it works)
